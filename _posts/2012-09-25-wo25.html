	<p class="bodytext">WO25 anchor is manufactured from 1/4" diameter wire and requires a job site or shop weld for installation.  Front protruding section of this anchor type is adequate in length to provide maximum flexibility for alignment of wire tie to mortar joint.  In most applications, the weld on anchor is welded directly to the structural iron frame components.  Physical characteristics of the wire weld on anchor make it the most suitable in structural iron applications.  Wire ties for use with weld on anchors are available in various projection sizes 3" to 9".</p>
