	<p class="bodytext">VA14 & VA12 anchors are manufactured with an integral back section to ensure positive lateral loading is transferred to the structural backup, minimizing the amount of veneer deflection.  Protruding front section of anchor is corrugated to provide maximum rigidity and strength in the tie slot.  Mounting holes are 1/4" diameter for screw type installation to structural steel framing, wood framing or concrete materials.  Wire ties installed with the anchor plate are available in various projection sizes 3" to 9".</p><p><a href="http://qswp.com/index.php/products/anchors/"><< Back to Products</a></p>
