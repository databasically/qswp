	<p class="bodytext">CS16 & CS18 dovetail anchors are manufactured for use with dovetail anchor slot in applications of masonry over poured concrete backup. Corrugations running across the width of CS anchors ensure a maximum amount of pull out resistance when the anchor is fully embedded in mortar. Dovetail anchor slot must be pre-installed in concrete to facilitate the use of CS type dovetail anchors. CS type dovetail anchors are available in 3 1/2" and 5 1/2" projection lengths. Other sizes and gauges are available upon special request.</p>
