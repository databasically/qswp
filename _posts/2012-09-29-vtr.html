	<p class="bodytext">VTR ties are rectangular shaped wire veneer ties used in various masonry veneer applications. This type of tie is at times used with adjustable type veneer anchors to properly align mortar joints and anchor. Rectangular ties are more commonly used to tie masonry veneer to masonry backup. VTR ties are produced from cold drawn steel wire with a finish coating of class 1 mill galvanized or hot dipped galvanized after fabrication. Two widths and five projection sizes are available, and special sizes are available upon request.</p><p><a href="http://qswp.com/index.php/products/anchors/"><< Back to Products</a></p>
