	<p class="bodytext">OB14 & OB12 anchors are  produced with an open back and used to anchor masonry to various types of structural backup.  Open back anchors are suitable in applications when backup materials are adequate to resist positive exterior loads on masonry and minimize the amount of deflection.  Anchor front section is corrugated to add strength and rigidity.  Â¼â€ diameter holes are provided in flat sections of anchor for attachment purposes.  Wire ties installed with open back anchors are available in various projection sizes 3â€ to 9â€.</p><p><a href="http://qswp.com/index.php/products/anchors/"><< Back to Products</a></p>
