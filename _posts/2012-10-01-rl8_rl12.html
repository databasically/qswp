	<p class="bodytext">RL8 & RL12 rebar positioners are manufactured from a single blank of wire, providing a cost effective method to position and stabilize rebar installed in concrete block core. As masonry core filling becomes more widely specified in many areas, rebar positioners have become a requirement of most building codes. Two sizes are available, designed for installation in 8" or 12" block. Double eye center section permits installation of two reinforcing bars. Special sizes and other styles of rebar positioners are available upon special request. </p><p><a href="http://qswp.com/index.php/products/anchors/"><< Back to Products</a></p>
