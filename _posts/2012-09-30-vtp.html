	<p class="bodytext">VTP ties are manufactured to be used with the RB14 veneer anchor or as a tie component in the wall systems that require a double eye and pintle to tie veneer into masonry backing. Two vertical leg extensions of the pintle provide adjustment in various applications to align masonry veneer mortar joints with the specific type of backup. Pintle ties are produced from cold drawn steel wire with a class 1 mill galvanized finish or hot dipped galvanized finish. Pintle ties are available in three projection sizes 3", 4", and 5".  Stainless steel and special size pintle ties are available upon request.</p><p><a href="http://qswp.com/index.php/products/anchors/"><< Back to Products</a></p>
